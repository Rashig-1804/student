Odissi is an ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the state of Odisha, India, tracing back to the 2nd Century BCE! It is one of the oldest surviving dance traditions in the world, and was first performed by maharis, temple dancers, as an offering to Lord Jagannath. According to sahapedia.org, Lord Jagannath, a god in Odisha, “was regarded as a living entity and whose image was worshipped as such” (Supriya Nayak). This special art form is a combination of graceful facial expressions, intricate hand gestures, strong foot stamping and movements, and colorful costumes!
