### About Me as A Dancer
Hi! My name is Rashi, and I love to dance. I am passionate about an Indian classical dance, Odissi, which is a very ancient art form with origins rooted in the temples of Odisha, India. I’ve been learning this for four years now! I really enjoy Odissi dance because it is a graceful and intricate way of expressing my Hindu culture. Dance in general always boosts my mood whether I’m feeling down or stressed out. It’s also my favorite way to exercise! I’ve had amazing opportunities to perform at several places including Balboa Park, ISKCON of San Diego, and performing arts centers to showcase my passion! I’ve been able to show my progress and even portray ancient, powerful stories of my culture! Whether the crowd is 1 or 400, I’m always ready.
