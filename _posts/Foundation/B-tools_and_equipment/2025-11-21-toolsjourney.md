## What I have learned
These past two weeks, I've learned about setting up operating systems on my windows computer! 
- I made an account on github, slack, and opencodingsociety
- I learned that github is a way to store and manage my code projects, and helps track every change I make
- I also joined the CSSE slack which is helpful for group communication
- Then, I made a copy of Mr. Mortensen's repository, Student, where I got a version to edit and add personalized information to. 
- I then worked on the about.md file within the navigation folder, where I added my own images and text
- Furthermore, I also learned how to access professional coding tools through a terminal, where we type in commands. I downloaded WSL, and Ubuntu, which are a part of Linux, and it is like a separate computer within my computer.
